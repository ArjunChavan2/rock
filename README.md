# Finding Rock Holds Using Computer Vision

## Description

I started this project during the fall of 2023 with the goal of creating a program 
that can find all the holds of an indoor rock climb, map them out, and eventually, 
find a route to the top. Indoor rock climbs are distinguishable by color, where each 
color represents a different climb.
